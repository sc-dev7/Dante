# SCHOOL - Project

## DESCRIPTION  
The goal of the **Dante** project is to generate and solve mazes using algorithms, while adhering to specific constraints for both functionality and performance.  
The project is divided into two main parts:  
1. **Maze Generator:** Creates a perfect or imperfect maze of specified dimensions.  
2. **Maze Solver:** Finds the shortest path from the maze's start to its end, if one exists.
